Welcome to Open Source Software (or OSS)!
"Open source" is a way of working on a project that relies on collaboration, decentralization,
and access.
Open source software makes source code available to users and invites a community of technical
and non-technical contributors to build on and improve it.
This course introduces you to open source software.
You'll learn the key concepts, tools, and processes to contribute to any open source
project.
First, you'll be introduced to open source software at a high level: what it is, how
it works, and why it matters.
Next, you'll learn how to contribute to an open source project, from identifying the
right project for you, to understanding the different ways to contribute, to following
best practices in the open source community.
You'll then get familiar with the tools you'll use to contribute to open source software
projects, including Git and GitHub.
Finally, you'll learn how to set up and host your own project and explore open source leadership,
governance, and community.
This course focuses on open source projects in the context of software development, but
you don't need coding skills to enroll and reap the benefits.
You'll learn how open source software projects are built and improved by a wide range of
contributors, including developers, designers, architects, editors, writers, and students.
The learning materials are delivered through easy-to-follow slides, videos, and demos,
and practice quizzes let you test your understanding of the material before you complete the graded
quiz for each module.
Whether you want to gain an understanding of open source projects or simply refresh
your open source development skills, this course is for you.
If you're an experienced developer or have no coding skills at all, you'll quickly gain
the knowledge and expertise to find, contribute to, and lead an open source software project.
